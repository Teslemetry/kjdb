# Key Json DataBase
Its like a key-value database, but it only stores JSON files. However the magic is that it will replicate these files to its peers, so that you have a local copy on each server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

To start the app in dev mode.\
Open [http://localhost:10001](http://localhost:10001) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start`

For production mode
